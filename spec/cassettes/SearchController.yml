        we believe the future of marketing lies within the untapped potential of digital
        content covering commercial products across the Web. We empower influential
        publishers who produce this content to connect enthusiastic consumers with
        the products they love from the brands who value them the most. We accomplish
        this directly through publishers\u2019 words, without need for an ad.</p>\n\n<p>By
        identifying commercial products mentioned within a publisher\u2019s content,
        VigLink automatically invigorates those terms by transforming them into hyperlinks
        whose destinations are determined in real-time, advertiser-bid auctions. Yes,
        hyperlinks, the defining feature of the Web from the very start. The literal
        \u201cH\u201d in HTML. Every time a clicked link takes a person from one destination
        to another, value is created. However, that value has never been fairly priced
        or available for purchase at scale. Until now.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2009,
        VigLink is located in heart of San Francisco and backed by top investors including
